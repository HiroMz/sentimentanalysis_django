Noticed this place next door and with four people that like Thai over Ramen decided to go in. We were seated quickly and placed our order.  We ordered Larb for an appetizer and then shrimp pad thai, chicken and green curry and vegetarian thai fried rice.  All four items came out at the same time, but very quickly.  Our favorite item was the chicken with green curry. Good flavor and just the right amount of heat. The pad thai was tasty and the fried rice was mild, but also good. The Larb was good, but we expect lettece leaves for wrapping with the Larb and only received a small amount  of chopped lettece. Probably didn't read the menu close enough.

We also enjoyed a couple of Thai coffees and a Singha Beer.  The coffees were good if not a bit on the sweet side, personal preference. The Singha always brings me back to a couple of enjoyable trips to Thailand. At $4.50 a bottle I would say a steal. Now for the big question, would I go back, hell yes. Small oasis in the wall. Give it a shot  for reasonably priced, joyful Thai food in a City with a lot of options."9,"We ordered a vegan Pad Kee Mao and Red Curry and both were SUPER SPICY. On confronting the server about the same, he kept saying that it was just medium spicy, inspite of us telling him otherwise. Let me also add in here that we're Indian, so we can handle A LOT of spice. When we reiterated how spicy it was and that my husband cannot handle this level of spice, he walked away. The owner (I think) was nice enough to bring us an extra bowl of steamed noodles, but overall, we were disappointed enough. We ate less than half our meal and left. 

Overall, a very disappointing experience."10,"Ordered Chicken Pad See Ew for lunch. Good serving of noodles, chicken, and veggies for the plate and the best part of it all is that it wasn't overly greasy and yet still flavorful. Didn't have to wait too long for my food to be served too. There's a small amount of seating inside so I can imagine it would be hard to grab a seat if it gets busy."11,"Stopped in for a quick lunch while in town for business. I ordered the green curry with pork which was brought to me only minutes later. I ordered it with medium to high spice and that is exactly what I got. Keep in mind that my tolerance for spice is very high. If you don't have a tolerance, I would ask for little to no spice. The flavor was very good and very satisfying. I would definitely order from here again."12,"Delicious food but very spicy if you aren't careful! I asked for mild and my mouth was on fire like painful spicy. But despite that, while I stayed in SF for the weekend, my friend and I went here twice because the food was so good! I had drunken noodles and basil fried rice. It is definitely a great hole in the wall with affordable prices."13,Food is very tasty and authentic.  Small place but cozy seating.  Had papaya salad and combo beef noodle soup. Really great service and fast.14,This business has been claimed by the owner or a representative.
